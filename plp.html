    <p class="sub-title">Redesign - 2018</p>
    <p class="content-title">Context</p>
    <p class="work-content">We believed there was an opportunity to increase the number of customers who go on to purchase after viewing a listing page.</p>
    <p class="mini-title">Business Opportunities</p>
    <ul class="work-bullet">
      <li>Funnel customers from PLP to view a PDP or add to cart from listing pages</li>
      <li>Improve visibility of products and key information</li>
      <li>Enhanced/new shopping features</li>
      <li>Support the responsive programme</li>
      <li>Making pages more ‘findable’</li>
      <li>Increase organic traffic</li>
    </ul>
    <img class="work-image" src="/img/plp/opp.png" alt="">
    <p class="mini-title">Current Experience</p>
    <p class="work-content">The current product listing page is messy and outdated compared to the rest of the site. Some features on the page are hard for users to use e.g. compare</p>
    <img class="work-image" src="/img/plp/current-plp.png" alt="">
    <p class="mini-title">Assumptions</p>
    <p class="work-content">The Product listing page design looks cluttered and overwhelming with the amount of information provided. Users aren’t inspired by the listing page and must click through to the product page to view and add items to the
      basket. Landing page SEO solutions are ineffective and not customer centric. The page is also not responsive.</p>
    <p class="content-title">The Discovery Phase</p>
    <p class="mini-title">Research hypothesis + Questions</p>
    <ol class="work-list">
      <li>Should we show different content by product type? Page type? Navigation type?</li>
      <li>Larger product images are a better experience?</li>
      <li>Is endless scroll the best experience?</li>
      <li>The role of the PLP is to shop or navigate from?</li>
      <li>The role of the PLP is to validate that the product is for the user? (Content)</li>
      <li>Do customers act upon urgency on PLP?</li>
      <li>PLP should be flexible by journey type? E.g. 'Filters' or 'Scrollers'</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mini-title">Research Approach</p>
    <p class="work-content">Overview of research Undertaken:</p>
    <ul class="work-bullet">
      <li>Hotjar Heatmaps – 9 Heatmaps 18,000 customers</li>
      <li>Hotjar Polls – 2 Polls 81 customers</li>
      <li>What Users Do – 14 tests, 82 participants 10+ hours of recordings</li>
      <li>Workshop – 2 Workshops</li>
      <li>Google Analytics</li>
      <li>Competitor Analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <img class="work-image" src="/img/plp/whatuserdo.png" alt="">
    <p class="mini-title">Noticeability Test</p>
    <p class="work-content">A research technique I used for learning whether people notice key elements in the designs</p>
    <img class="work-image" src="/img/plp/noticeability.png" alt="">
    <p class="mini-title">Group Competitor Analysis</p>
    <p class="work-content">After completing my own competitor analysis I created a workshop around looking at our competitors and invited staff from all round the business to have their input. The results were extremely valuable.</p>
    <img class="work-image" src="/img/plp/analysis.png" alt="">
    <p class="mini-title">Areas of opportunity</p>
    <p class="work-content">From the user research and business needs the team broke each opportunity into nine epics. </p>

    </ul>

    <p class="content-title">The Design Phase</p>
    <p class="mini-title">Design Studio</p>
    <p class="work-content">We kicked off the Design Phase with a Design Studio. In the past we’ve found this an effective way to produce wireframes in a fast way and so all people from around the business can have their input into the designs earlier rather than later.</p>
    <img class="work-image" src="/img/plp/design-studio.png" alt="">
    <p class="mini-title">UX planning</p>
    <p class="work-content">We worked in a agile way so a plan was drawn up to follow and the team met up everyday for 30 minutes for updates and feedback.</p>
    <p class="mini-title">High fidelity Mockups</p>
    <p class="work-content">The high fidelity mockups were created in photoshop. Each version of the design or alteration to the design were printed and displayed on the wall for reference. This also let the whole business see our designs and feedback any concerns they had.</p>
    <img class="work-image" src="/img/plp/high-fid.png" alt="">
    <p class="mini-title">Design Session</p>
    <p class="work-content">Quick buy later named to Quick view was the most complicated feature on the product listing page. Three designs were drawn up in paper prototypes to show each journey and the behaviour of the quick view to the project team. From this discussion two of the designs were created into high fidelity and when presented back to the team the choice to go with a sliding quick view was decided. </p>
    <img class="work-image" src="/img/plp/quickview.png" alt="">
    <p class="mini-title">User Testing</p>
    <p class="work-content">At this point we had a working prototype that our UI designer had made and a lot of design changes had happened with addition of the sliding quick view. A small Whatusersdo test was setup to check the design changes made sense to our customers to de risk the project going forward. The results showed the our customers had no issues using the new design and understood the quick view feature</p>
    <p class="mini-title">Final Designs</p>
    <p class="work-content">The final flat designs were mocked up and prototype updated ready for development</p>
