    <p class="content-title">Context</p>
    <p class="work-content">Wiggle recently acquired Chain Reaction Cycle (CRC) and created a project called BMX to revamp the entire website to bring it up to date.</p>
    <p class="mini-title">Business Opportunities</p>
    <ul class="work-bullet">
      <li>Improve CRC design/brand</li>
      <li>Create a style guide for the website to make the site more consistent in design</li>
      <li>Identify current user issues</li>
      <li>Support the responsive programme</li>
      <li>Improve accessibility</li>
      <li>Increase organic traffic</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mini-title">Current Experience</p>
    <p class="work-content">The current website is messy and cluttered as well as outdated compared to the current Wiggle website. Some features on the site are also hard to find and difficult to use.</p>
    <img class="work-image" src="/img/bmx/currentcrc.png" alt="">
    <p class="mini-title">Assumptions</p>
    <p class="work-content">The biggest restriction on this project was the time limit. Each epic was given about one week to research, design, prototype and test.</p>
<p class="content-title">The Design Phase</p>
<p class="work-content"> As we were very restricted on time I was given the epics I had knowledge of due to researching and designing them for Wiggle’s website. As these had been done fairly recently it meant I could apply this knowledge and skip straight to designing and then prototyping. </p>
    <p class="mini-title">Epics</p>
    <ul class="work-bullet">
      <li>Header</li>
      <li>Footer</li>
      <li>Product Listing Page</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mini-title">Header</p>

    <img class="work-image" src="/img/bmx/designheader.png" alt="">
    <p class="mini-title">Footer</p>
    <img class="work-image" src="/img/bmx/designfooter.png" alt="">
    <p class="mini-title">Product Listing Page</p>
    <img class="work-image" src="/img/bmx/designplp.png" alt="">
<p class="content-title">Conclusion</p>
<p class="work-content">Having the research knowledge from Wiggle’s site made the designing and prototyping phase a lot quicker. So when testing with users very few alterations needed to be made. I’ve also moved on to a new role so wishing all the best to the UX/UI team in Wiggle with getting this massive project finished.</p>
